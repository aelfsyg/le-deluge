* Zeal
A /Zeal/ mechanic allows us to model some of the more nonsensical things that happened during the Revolution, such as the Terror and the execution of Marie Antoinette. Zeal reduces the stability of political compromise.

Should Zeal only be active for Revolutionary Republics? Or for all nations, increasing revolt risk.

Zeal is increased whenever a Coalition War is won, when a new Revolutionary Republic is established, or territory is taken.
