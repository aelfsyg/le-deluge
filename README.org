Après moi, le déluge.

— Louis XV of France
#+END_QUOTE

Le Déluge is a Victoria 3 mod which follows the events of the French Revolution and the rise of the First French Republic and Empire; it starts in 1786, fifty years before Vic 3's standard bookmark and with the events of the Revolution just around the corner.

France is both the most powerful country in the world, and yet unable to raise taxes and on the verge of bankruptcy. To fix France's financial problems, we can call together the Estates-General for the first time in 170 years; hopefully, the clergy, nobility, and commoners will be able to put aside their differences or else we risk the downfall of Europe's greatest monarchy.

The mod allows one to follow the course of history, or try and solve France's problems another way. If one chooses the historical action, one is guaranteed to have the Napoleonic Wars ensue.

If Europe can survive the Déluge: Spain will face a wave of independence amongst her colonies, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth will have to try and outmanoeuvre her three unfriendly neighbours, and the UK must either abolish slavery or deal with unrest amongst her populace.

** Early, pre-Revolution
- Royalists (Absolute Monarchists)
- Feuillants (Constitutional Monarchists)

* Coalition Wars
The Coalition Wars were a series of seven wars waged by various alliances of great European powers against Revolutionary France. These wars will be heavily in France's favour, and you might be required to lose several before France meets its defeat.

Le Déluge uses Crises to model the Coalition Wars. The taking of states other than those on France's border is prohibitively expensive, so France is best placed to install puppet governments, or to pressure governments into alliances and the Continental System. Establishing a new liberal order in Europe will require France to succeed in several wars against all of Europe.


* Continental System
The Continental System was a embargo by almost the entirety of Europe against the United Kingdom. Representing this is almost impossible in Vic 2, but Vic 3's market mechanics make the Continental System an easy feature to implement.

Vic 3's variable number of great powers means in a Coalition War the French can make their opponents submit to the French market and embargo the United Kingdom, even large powers, such as Austria and the Russian Empire.

Historically, the failure of countries to enforce the embargo was used by Napoleon as a /casus belli/ for the invasions of the Spanish and Russian Empires, and in Le Déluge countries will be given the opportunity to flout French impositions, but may pay a price for doing so.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators, has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished for ever.

— Edmund Burke

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Peoples do not judge in the same way as courts of law; they do not hand down sentences, they throw thunderbolts; they do not condemn kings, they drop them back into the void; and this justice is worth just as much as that of the courts.

— Robespierre
