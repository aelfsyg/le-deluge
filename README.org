Après moi, le déluge.

— Louis XV of France
#+END_QUOTE

Le Déluge is a Victoria 3 mod which follows the events of the French Revolution and the rise of the First French Republic and Empire; it starts in 1786, fifty years before Vic 3's standard bookmark and with the events of the Revolution just around the corner.

France is both the most powerful country in the world, and yet unable to raise taxes and on the verge of bankruptcy. To fix France's financial problems, we can call together the Estates-General for the first time in 170 years; hopefully, the clergy, nobility, and commoners will be able to put aside their differences or else we risk the downfall of Europe's greatest monarchy.

The mod allows one to follow the course of history, or try and solve France's problems another way. If one chooses the historical action, one is guaranteed to have the Napoleonic Wars ensue.

If Europe can survive the Déluge: Spain will face a wave of independence amongst her colonies, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth will have to try and outmanoeuvre her three unfriendly neighbours, and the UK must either abolish slavery or deal with unrest amongst her populace.

* Events
- The French Revolution
- The Spanish American Wars of Independence
- Partitions of Poland
- Abolitionism
- Acts of Union
- Revolutions of 1820
- Greek War of Independence
- July Revolution
- and many smaller events

* Political groups
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_groups_in_the_French_Revolution

** Early, pre-Revolution
- Royalists (Absolute Monarchists)
- Feuillants (Constitutional Monarchists)
- Girondins (Liberals)
- Montagnards (Radicals)

** Late, post-Revolution
- Bourbonists (Absolute Monarchists)
- Orléanists (Constitutional Monarchists)
- Thermidorians, Cordeliers (Liberals)
- Enragés, Sans-culottes (Dirigists)

* Coalition Wars
Crises are used to model the Coalition Wars. The taking of states is prohibitively expensive, so France is best placed to install puppet governments. Establishing a new liberal order in Europe will require France to succeed in several wars.

* Continental System
The Continental System was a embargo by almost the entirety of Europe against the United Kingdom. This will be modelled using Vic 3's market mechanics, a welcome addition as this would be hard to model in Vic 2.

* Economics
Model the 'putting-out' system.

* Questions
Should all the countries use the same tags that they will use in the rest of the game? Some decisions might need to be hidden by adding a date for them to become available.

* Quotations
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators, has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished for ever.

— Edmund Burke

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Peoples do not judge in the same way as courts of law; they do not hand down sentences, they throw thunderbolts; they do not condemn kings, they drop them back into the void; and this justice is worth just as much as that of the courts.

— Robespierre
