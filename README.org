Après moi, le déluge.

— Louis XV of France
#+END_QUOTE

Le Déluge is a Victoria 3 mod which follows the events of the French Revolution and the rise of the First French Republic and Empire; it starts in 1786, fifty years before Vic 3's standard bookmark and with the events of the Revolution just around the corner. France is both the most powerful country in the world, and yet unable to raise taxes and on the verge of bankruptcy.

The mod allows one to follow the course of history, or try and solve France's problems another way. If one chooses the historical action, one if guaranteed to have the Napoleonic Wars ensue.

* Political groups
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_groups_in_the_French_Revolution

** Early, pre-Revolution
- Royalists (Absolute Monarchists)
- Feuillants (Constitutional Monarchists)
- Girondins (Liberals)
- Montagnards (Radicals)

** Late, post-Revolution
- Bourbonists (Absolute Monarchists)
- Orléanists (Constitutional Monarchists)
- Thermidorians, Cordeliers (Liberals)
- Enragés, Sans-culottes (Dirigists)

* Coalition Wars
Crises are used to model the Coalition Wars. The taking of states is prohibitively expensive, so France is best placed to install puppet governments. Establishing control over Europe will require France to succeed in several wars.

* Events and decisions

** The French Revolution

*** Debt repayments
Will France honour its debts?

Brienne or Necker?

*** Estates-General
- First Estate :: clergy
- Second Estate :: nobility
- Third Estate :: commoners

The first event France receives allows one to choose whether to assemble the Estates-General. This will allow one to attempt to reform France's terrible financial situation, at the risk that the Third Estate will achieve more that just this. The player can refuse this, in which case reform must be hard won through the use of personal Authority.

One must then decide on the composition of the Estates-General. Traditionally, each Estate was granted an equal share of the votes, but this will upset the Third Estate who see themselves in opposition to the conservative First and Second Estates.

If the demands of the Third Estate are not acquiesced to, they will form their own Assembly, and issue their own rulings. They will be hard to ignore. If one chooses to recognise the Assembly, their demands will be more radical than if they had been listened to from the beginning.

Alternatively, one can ally oneself with the Third Estate to tax the incredibly rich nobility, but doing so will make enemies of those who are the monarchy's only supporters, and rid the nation of its few remaining Loyalists.

Eventually there will be a vote, the representatives of which will determine France's future.

*** Émigres
Aristocrats, Capitalists, Generals, and Admirals will flee if the Revolution succeeds.

The loss of many generals will be compensated by the rise of young men who had previously gone unnoticed.

The loss of skilled men leaves the navy in disarray. Allies will be necessary if France is ever to compete on the high seas.

*** Louisiana Purchase
Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. Spain trades Spanish Louisiana for territories in Tuscany. France sells Louisiana to the United States.

1803, $15M. An investment like this can make a huge difference to a country in dire straits. Especially when they will be unable to gain naval dominance.

*** The Low Countries
Batavian Republic

*** The First French Empire
Proclaim the First French Empire.

*** Congress of Vienna
Union between Sweden and Norway

** Spanish American wars of independence

** Partitions of Poland

** Abolitionism

* Questions
Should all the countries use the same tags that they will use in the rest of the game? Some decisions might need to be hidden by adding a date for them to become available.

* Quotations
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators, has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished for ever.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Peoples do not judge in the same way as courts of law; they do not hand down sentences, they throw thunderbolts; they do not condemn kings, they drop them back into the void; and this justice is worth just as much as that of the courts.
